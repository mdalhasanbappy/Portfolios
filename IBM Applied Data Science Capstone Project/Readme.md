## üìÑ Project Overview  

SpaceX revolutionized commercial space travel by significantly reducing the cost of rocket launches, thanks to reusable first-stage boosters. This project analyzes publicly available data to predict the success of these booster landings and identifies the critical factors affecting their success rates.  

### Key Objectives:  
- Understand how variables like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect landing success.  
- Explore trends in landing success rates over the years.  
- Identify the best machine learning model for binary classification to predict landing success.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  

The project follows a structured data science workflow:  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - SpaceX REST API  
   - Web Scraping from SpaceX Wikipedia page  

2. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Cleaning and preparing data for analysis  
   - Encoding categorical variables for machine learning  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing trends and relationships using Python and SQL  
   - Insights into success rates by launch sites, orbits, payload mass, and years  

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics**  
   - **Folium**: Built an interactive map for launch site locations and outcomes  
   - **Plotly Dash**: Developed dashboards for dynamic data exploration  

5. **Machine Learning**  
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Best model: **Decision Tree** (highest accuracy and F1 score)

## üìä Key Results  

### üîç Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Success Trends**: Success rates increased significantly over the years, with KSC LC-39A being the most successful launch site.  
- **Payload Mass vs Success**: Launches with payloads between 2000-5500 kg had the highest success rates.  
- **Orbit Insights**: Orbits like ES-L1, GEO, and SSO achieved 100% success rates, while SO had a 0% success rate.  

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Visualizations  
- **Launch Sites**: Most sites are near the equator and coasts, minimizing risks from failed launches.  
- **Success Distribution**: Launch site KSC LC-39A had the highest success rates for both payload mass and total launches.  

### ü§ñ Predictive Analysis  
- **Best Model**: Decision Tree Model  
- **Accuracy**: The Decision Tree outperformed other models in predicting landing success, achieving the highest overall accuracy.
