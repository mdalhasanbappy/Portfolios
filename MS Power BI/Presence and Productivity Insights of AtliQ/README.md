## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques
1. **Power BI**:
   - Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
   - Dashboard creation and visualization.
2. **Excel**:
   - Data preprocessing and organization.
   - Handling masked attendance data.
3. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**:
   - Calculated measures for:
     - Work-from-home percentage.
     - Sick leave percentage.
     - Other key metrics.

---

## üìä Insights and Use Cases
- **HR Analytics**:
  - Identify attendance trends and patterns.
  - Optimize remote work and sick leave policies.
- **Employee Engagement**:
  - Improve presence and productivity by pinpointing improvement areas.
- **Business Efficiency**:
  - Align workforce attendance with organizational goals.

## üìù Project Workflow
1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Gathered requirements from HR representative Pinali Mandalia.
   - Scoped project goals and outlined deliverables.
2. **Data Collection and Transformation**:
   - Extracted and cleaned attendance data from Excel using Power Query.
   - Handled multiple sheets with varying column headers.
3. **Metric Development**:
   - Created measures for WFH%, SL%, and presence using DAX.
   - Added additional metrics based on stakeholder feedback.
4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built an interactive and user-friendly dashboard in Power BI.
   - Incorporated HR-specific insights and functionality.

## üí° Why This Project Stands Out
- Simulates a **real-world HR analytics scenario**.
- Tackles challenges like handling complex, masked datasets and transforming them for analysis.
- Demonstrates advanced Power BI capabilities, including Power Query and DAX.
- Delivered a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** with scope for future enhancements.
