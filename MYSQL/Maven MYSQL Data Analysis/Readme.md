# Maven Movies: SQL Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Maven Movies SQL Data Analysis Repository! This repository showcases my work on the **Mid-Course Project** and **Final Course Project** for a SQL-based data analysis exercise. These projects involve designing SQL queries to extract, analyze, and summarize data from a movie rental database, addressing various business problems.

## Project Overview

The Maven Movies database contains information about customers, inventory, staff, payments, and rentals. In these projects, I worked on writing efficient SQL queries to provide actionable insights, monitor business performance, and support decision-making.

### **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- SQL Query Optimization
- Data Extraction and Transformation
- Aggregation and Grouping
- Business Insights and Reporting
- JOIN Operations and Subqueries

## Mid-Course Project

The **Mid-Course Project** focused on solving specific business questions such as:
1. Listing staff details by store.
2. Counting inventory items per store.
3. Counting active customers per store.
4. Assessing the liability of customer data storage.
5. Analyzing the diversity of film titles and categories.
6. Understanding replacement costs for films.
7. Monitoring payment processing for fraud risk.
8. Identifying high-volume customers based on rentals.

## Final Course Project

The **Final Course Project** was designed to provide a deeper analysis of business performance by solving more advanced problems, including:
1. Identifying store managers and their store addresses.
2. Summarizing inventory by store, rating, and category.
3. Analyzing replacement costs by category and store.
4. Providing a comprehensive customer profile analysis.
5. Calculating customer lifetime value (total rentals and payments).
6. Aggregating board members and investors in a single view.
7. Evaluating the representation of award-winning actors in inventory.
