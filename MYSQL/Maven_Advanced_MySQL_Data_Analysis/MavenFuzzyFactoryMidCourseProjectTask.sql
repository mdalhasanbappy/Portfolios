1.	Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly 
trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there? 
*/ 


/*
2.	Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand 
and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell. 
*/ 

/*
3.	While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? 
I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources. 
*/ 


/*
4.	I’m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. 
Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?
*/ 




/*
5.	I’d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. 
Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?

/*
6.	For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us 
(Hint: Look at the increase in CVR from the test (Jun 19 – Jul 28), and use 
nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)
*/ 



/*
7.	For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel 
from each of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).
*/ 




/*
8.	I’d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated 
from the test (Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number 
of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.
